This is the fifth challenge in my bootcamp on front-end web development. In this challenge we are tasked to create a password generator. I was given the html and css code however had to create the javascript code to make the website function.

The instruction were as follows:

Generate a password when the button is clicked:
    -Present a series of prompts for password criteria
        -Length of password
            -At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
        -Character types
            -Lowercase
            -Uppercase
            -Numeric
            -Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
    -Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
    -Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
